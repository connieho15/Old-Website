									<h3>Meet-Up</h3>
									<p>This was my first project ever! This mobile app allows users to input their class schedules. After that, the app will find a time for the user and their "friend" to meet (assuming this "friend" has this app as well, but that part was simulated). The app will then find a common time and location that the two can meet, using Google Maps and Foursquare API for locations and routes. For bonus, I also added reviews and cuisine choice from the API.</p>

									<h3>Datrend vPad IDE</h3>
									<p>During my work term at Datrend Systems, I developed the vPad-IDE, an IDE written entirely in C# that is configured for custom VPL and RFA languages developed by the company to be used on vPad Android Tablets by Biomedical Maintenance teams in hospitals. The IDE allows non-technical staff to be able to write scripts and instructions to be executed on tablets with features like auto-completion and syntax highlighting, while customizing their maintenance systems for different equipment and regulations. Extra features include Android Emulation, PDF/Word Export and Bluetooth Export.</p>

									<h3>Split My Trip</h3>
									<p>This website was built at UBC Local Hack Day Hackathon. In a team of 4, we managed to do this in 12 hours. The aim of this website is to track and organize travel expenses. The user can input their expenses including who paid and who was involved in the transaction. Then the app will calculate how much each person owes the other, while minimizing the number of transactions using a graph-based algorithm. Given more time, we would have liked to implement social media linked accounts and multi-currency support. </p>
